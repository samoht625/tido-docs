At some point in the journey you will encounter this situation:

- someone is not performing and you want to manage them out
- you (or their old manager or whoever) have not given them appropriate feedback
- you have lost confidence in the person and would like to part ways ASAP

Try this:

> Unfortunately, I have lost confidence in this role being the right fit for your skillset. I sense that you have also lost enthusiasm about the role. I am happy to prepare a more structured Performance Improvement Plan, but I do recommend you consider taking _X_ weeks of severance instead. I think this path will be easier for us both — you are a talented human and I believe will have more success with a different role setup. I'd ask that you sleep on it tonight and I will set time for us to meet at 9am tomorrow morning to discuss.

If you have lost confidence, it's better for everyone to call a spade a spade and not lead them on with a PIP that's likely not going to work out. However, if they believe they can succeed in the face of this feedback, it's your legal obligation as a company to give them that structured feedback. (If they've already gotten enough structured feedback that HR feels they've been given a fair chance, you can adjust the script to tell them that their last day is today.)

If this article made you think of someone on your team, do me a favor: stop thinking, start acting. Make a meeting with HR tomorrow. Deal with this issue by the end of the week. Sitting on it is not helping anyone (including the person who is underperforming — I promise you they are not happy either.)

<Note>
Before delivering this, you should check with your HR team to ensure that this is appropriate given your company policies. Also, you'll need their input on what severance your company is able to offer. I recommend 2-6 weeks, matching how long the PIP would be.
