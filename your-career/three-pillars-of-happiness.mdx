The most common conversation I have with people is when they are considering a career move, whether it's their <a>"Shields Down" moment</a> or deep in the offer process. Over the years, I've seen some absurdly complex spreadsheets (eg., 15 pros and cons, expected value of equity, concerns about RSUs/Options/Strike Price, etc.). And while I do think there is a place for those spreadsheets, I've craved a simpler model. 

I think career happiness boils down to three key pillars. If you have 3/3 of these, you are almost certainly going to be wildly happy. If you have 2.5/3 of these, you're pretty good. Anything less and you'll be looking for another job soon.

**Pillar #1 - Compensation**
For senior folks (think expert-level ICs or senior manager plus), the way I'd frame the question to you is: if this company does well, could it be a life-changing outcome for you? I assume that you are excellent and will be working hard — in exchange for that excellence and hard work, you deserve a _chance_ at a life-changing outcome. There is some homework in here of figuring out with your partner/family/yourself what a life-changing outcome actually means. It could be a range of things — a downpayment for a house, the ability to support your parents in a more serious way, the financial freedom to retire early, or whatever else you value.

For junior folks, the way I'd frame the question to you is: is this compensation fair for the value you'll bring? I wouldn't focus too much on the area under the curve if you're in the first 5-10 years of your career — focus on the other two and come back to this pillar in a bit. 

**Pillar #2 - finding a you-shaped hole**
You will have more fun, make more impact, have better financial outcomes if you find a you-shaped hole. 

> When I joined Segment at a more senior stage (VP Engineering), it was clear to me that (1) Segment had found incredible PMF and (2) the one problem holding Segment back from glory was hiring a world-class engineering team. This was what I had to offer the world, so it was a perfect match. (And the rest was history...)

**Pillar #3 - peers and management chain**
As you probably know, the people matter a lot. To help you hone in on what matters most, I'd specifically try to understand if you would have any weak points up your management chain — I've found that as soon as there is a weak point anywhere in the chain, things unravel quickly. I'd also pay attention to your peers — are they world-class people you are going to learn from and have a blast working with. 

If you are inheriting a team you'd be managing, I wouldn't worry as much about the team. After all, it's now your job to make that team amazing!
