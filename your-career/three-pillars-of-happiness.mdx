title: 'Three pillars of happiness'
description: "The most common conversation I have with people"

I've seen some absurdly complex spreadsheets used to navigate pros and cons of a new job. I don't mind a good spreadsheet (my cofounders like to joke that Google Sheets is my proficient technical tool these days...), but I do think career happiness boils down to three key pillars. 

## Pillar #1 - Compensation
Whether or not you want to admit it to yourself, this is an integral part of the thought process as you change jobs. (That's okay!) Here's a framing I heard from an early mentor:

### For senior folks:

> Does this meet my family's current lifestyle needs and — if things go great — could this be a life-changing outcome?

For senior folks, you have paid your dues working your tail off. You are going to be working hard and bringing an immense amount of value to the company you join. You should be working toward something exciting!

**Current needs:** How much do we actually spend each year as a family? How much do I need to contribute each year to ensure our existing lifestyle is supported? Going to a startup can be scary, but many people I talk to are surprised at what they find from this simple exercise and are more prepared than they thought to support making a bet on a life-changing startup outcome. Not saying it's right for you, but it's worth doing the math.

**Life-changing outcome:** There is some homework embedded in this question — go talk to your partner and/or any key family members. Is it a downpayment for a house? The ability to support your parents as they get older? The financial freedom to retire early? Having a clear goal will help you figure out what risk/reward tolerance you want.

### For junior folks:

> Is this compensation fair for the value I bring?

I wouldn't focus too much on the "area under the curve" for your next job if you're in the first 5-10 years of your career. Optimize for the other two pillars, and think about this pillar next time you do a job change!

## Pillar #2 - finding a you-shaped hole
You will have more fun, make more impact, have better financial outcomes if you find a you-shaped hole. 

> When I joined Segment at a more senior stage (VP Engineering), it was clear to me that (1) Segment had found incredible PMF and (2) the one problem holding Segment back from glory was hiring a world-class engineering team. This was what I had to offer the world, so it was a perfect match. (And the rest was history...)

## Pillar #3 - management chain
As you probably know, the people matter a lot. To help you hone in on what matters most, I'd specifically try to understand if you would have any weak points up your management chain — I've found that as soon as there is a weak point anywhere in the chain, things unravel quickly.

### What is enough?
My general sense is that having a full three out of three, you are almost certainly going to be wildly happy. And two-and-a-half out of three, things are likely looking pretty good. But as soon as you have two or fewer, you'll probably be looking for another job soon (even if you haven't admitted it to yourself yet).
