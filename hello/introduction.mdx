description: "An introduction to Tido Docs (aka the guide he wishes he had when he started his career."

My name is Tido and I've been lucky enough to learn from some of the best people in Silicon Valley across Facebook, Dropbox, Segment, and now at Koala. 

In the past few years, I've found myself giving more and more advice on the following topics: 

- to tech folks about their career journeys
- to people managers about hiring, firing, helping their team grow
- to founders about company-building

Whenever I give the same advice twice, I have promised myself I will write it down here in case it is useful for others.

I hope you find something useful in your stay. And if you have something in mind but didn't find an answer, shoot me a note: tido@getkoala.com.
